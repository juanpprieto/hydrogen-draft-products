# Hydrogen draft products preview

This example illustrates how to render draft products in Hydrogen

### Approach
`/product/[handle].server.jsx` â€” looks for a `preview=true` query param. If found, it attempts to fetch the product data via the Admin API (can return drafts), otherwise fetch normally from the Storefront API.

### Required env vars
- `SHOPIFY_ADMIN_API_VERSION`=2022-04
- `SHOPIFY_STORE_DOMAIN`=yourshop.myshopify.com
- `SHOPIFY_STOREFRONT_API_PUBLIC_TOKEN`=abcdefg..
- `SHOPIFY_ADMIN_API_PRIVATE_TOKEN`=123456.. (product and product_listing read scope)
